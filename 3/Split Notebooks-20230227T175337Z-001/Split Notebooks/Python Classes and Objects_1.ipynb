    "# Python Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object oriented programming language. Everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A number, string, list, dictionary, tuple, set etc. used in a program is an object of a corresponding built-in class. We create class to create an object. Unlike procedure oriented programming, where the main emphasis is on functions, object oriented programming stresses on objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "As many houses can be made from a house's blueprint, we can create many objects from a class. An object is also called an instance of a class and the process of creating this object is called **instantiation**. We instantiate a class to create an object. The class defines attributes and the behavior of the object, while the object, on the other hand, represents the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been working with classes and objects right from the beginning of this challenge unknowingly. Every element in a Python program is an object of a class. Let us check if everything in python is a class:"

    "In general, calling a method with a list of n arguments is equivalent to calling the corresponding function with an argument list that is created by inserting the method's object before the first argument.\n",

    "For these reasons, the first argument of the function in class must be the object itself. This is conventionally called self. It can be named otherwise but we highly recommend to follow the convention.\n",
