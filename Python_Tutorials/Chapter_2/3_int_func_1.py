# number_one = int(input("enter first number ")) # 4
# number_two = int(input("enter second number ")) # 4
# total = number_one + number_two 
# print("total is " + str(total))

# total = "4" + "4" = 44 This is taking 4 as a string that's why 4 and 4 are different.

# string func changes func to string func Ex str 4 ----> "4"

# int func "4" ----> 4

# float "4" ----> 4.0
number1 = str(4)
number2 = float("44") # decimal
number3 = int("33")
print(number1)
print(number2)
print(number3)
print(number2 + number3) # Float and int can be added but the result will be in float. 
# print(number1 + number2) str and int cannot be added because number1 is a str and number 2 is a float which is a number
