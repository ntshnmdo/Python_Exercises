# Functions
# name = "Nitish"
# print(len(name)) # len is the pre defined function of python
# But what is we want to define a function. 
# So we define a function in python by 'def'. For example

def add_two(x,y): # We defined a function,
    return x + y # and we want to return x + y for that defined function.

# print(add_two(5,6)) # We can directly print by writing function and any values of x and y. 

# number1 = int(input("Enter 1st number : "))
# number2 = int(input("Enter 2nd number : "))
# print(add_two(number1,number2))

first_name = input("type 1st name : ")
last_name = input("type last name : ")
print(add_two(first_name, last_name))
