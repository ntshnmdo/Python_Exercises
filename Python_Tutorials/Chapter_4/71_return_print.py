# Return vs print

# def add_three(a,b,c):
#     return a+b+c

# print(add_three(6,6,6))

# we can also directly use print instead of return. for example

def add_three(a,b,c):
    print(a+b+c)

add_three(6,6,6)

# but return is more good to use than print as sometimes we dont want to print and only want to return.
