# list vs string

# strings are immutable  means string cannot be changed but instead of it a new string can be made and change

# list are mutable
# especially in python
s = "string"
# t= s.title() #title() function captilises the first letter.
# s string doesnt changed instead we have to make a new string t and in it the title changed
# print(t)

# since list is mutable 

l = ["word1", "word2", "word3"]
# l.pop()
# pop() function pop out the last word of the original list
# in string we cannot append but in list we can

l.append("word4")
print(l)
