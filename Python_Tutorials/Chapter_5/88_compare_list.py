# compare lists
# is, and == function

fruits1 = ['pear', 'banana', 'mango', 'apple']
fruits2 = ['apple', 'orange', 'kiwi']
fruits3 = ['apple', 'orange', 'kiwi']

# print(fruits1 == fruits2) 
# false, since values are different in the lists

# print(fruits2 == fruits3) 
# True, since values are same

# print(fruits1 is fruits2) 
# false, since fruits1 and fruits2 are two different objects and occupies separate place in the memory

# print(fruits2 is fruits3) # similar case 

print(fruits1 is fruits1) 
# True, since fruits1 and fruits1 are both same objects and occupies same place in the memory. we will learn more about OOP later.
