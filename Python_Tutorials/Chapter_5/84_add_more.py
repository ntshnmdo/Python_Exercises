# more methods to add data to the list
# insert method
# how to join (concatenate) two list
# extend method
# difference b/w append and extend method

fruits1 = ['mango', 'orange']
#1 fruits1.insert(1, "grapes")
# print(fruits1)
fruits2 = ['grapes', 'banana']
# fruits = fruits1 + fruits2 # concatenate
# print(fruits)

fruits1.append(fruits2)
print(fruits1)

# that's why extend function is used more. than append
