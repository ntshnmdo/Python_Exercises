# list vs array
# array means ordered collections of items in English
# and list is the ordered collection of items in python. list - stores any data in python

# C, C++, Java can store only one data type in an array. Like int, string.

# In python
# but in python 'list function'we can store any data type in array
# python array_module - are not pre installed in python rather we import in python. In this also we can store only one data type. But we rarely use it though it has good performance 
# instead we use numpy module ---> numpy arrays for data science calculation because numpy libraries binding with C libraries which makes it equally faster in performance as C
# list function is really flexible, therefore we use it more often. 

# Javascript - is same as python list in which we can store only one type of data type but flexible as python list

# bridge between C and python
