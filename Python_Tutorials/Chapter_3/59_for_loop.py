# For loop with range funtion, range function is very imp

for i in range(1, 11): # i is variable and it can be any name ex time, unit, n, h, etc
                    # range is going from 0 to 9 
                    # to make range of i from 1 to 10 we have to write range(1, 11) this means i will range from 1 to 10 but it will not include 11.
    print(f"hello world : {i}")
